# configs
This project contains the configuration files which I use in my daily life. Be it an IDE configuration, a system configuration or a simple tool configuration -- this helps me getting unified across all my systems.

1. .gitconfig
Contains all the git related config. This file is inspired by [this](https://github.com/durdn/cfg/blob/master/.gitconfig). Even most of it is directly copied. ;)
